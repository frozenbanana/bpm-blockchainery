\begin{abstract}

    Make it clear that we are talking about an implementation of ACs, not the BPMN standard!

    We are working towards implementing a realization of ACs, that implements some visibility constraints that you would usually see in real-world applications, like confidential data and transactions.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

privacy in inter-organizational process execution.

The goal of this paper is to explore the notions of privacy and visibility with regards to untrusted execution of choreographies on the blockchain.



\section{Background and Motivation} \label{sec:backgrounmotivation}

\subsection{Blockchain-Based choreographies} \label{subsec:blockchainbased}

basically a more specific Introduction

what did Ingo do?

what did Jan do? 

\subsection{Privacy Considerations} \label{subsec:privacy}

However, while discussing privacy issues, Weber et al. and Ladleif did not take any measures to actually implement them...

talk about layers. Why are they important? 

Motivation!

\subsection{Privacy Enhancing Technologies} \label{subsec:technologies}

talk about technologies that are currently out there 

try to be a bit more high-level, not too focused on possible solutions




\section{Approach} \label{sec:approach}

\subsection{Assumptions and Scenario} \label{subsec:assumptions}

\textbf{do I need this? Am I referring to any of the specific points later on?}



Before introducing our schema, we would like to mention the assumptions on which our proposal is based on. Each premise is marked for potential later reference.


\bigbreak
\textbf{Assumptions about the participating parties}: \ber{a} There are several parties which want to collaborate. These parties have \ber{b} neither trust in each other nor \ber{c} trust in any third party. They furthermore \ber{d} want to keep their business process secret, \ber{e} hide with whom they are collaborating and \ber{f} hide what messages are exchanged during the collaboration. Since the parties distrust each other they also \ber{g} only want to share messages with the entities that have to see them and keep them secret from the others. Each party \ber{f} is "honest but curious" \textbf{[ref]}. They follow the protocol, but will try to collect as much information as possible. 



\textbf{Mention} \ber{x} $ \rightarrow $ to layers from \refsec{subsec:blockchainbased}

\bigbreak
\textbf{Further assumptions:}
All data that is \ber{g} processed on the blockchain is considered public. It is \ber{h} possible to convert a business process into a program or state-machine in order for parties to determine that validity of a state change.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item shortcomings
    \item How could mentioned in \refsec{subsec:technologies} improve \refsec{sec:eval}?
    \item How did it work out in the end? 
    \item private blockchain
    \item Parity
    \item future work
