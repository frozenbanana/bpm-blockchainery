Smart contracts are becoming more and more powerful and important.

One area of interest is the use of SCs in inter-organizational processes (choreographies).

This includes business contracts or other agreements between different parties.

However, these types of real-world contracts have certain constraints for visibility and privacy:

businesses might not be willing to publicly disclose their contractsâ€™ terms,

participants may not want everyone to know who they are dealing with,

and the actual content of contracts might be confidential.

These constraints have not been adequately tackled yet on both a conceptual as well as a technical level.

Research Question: How can we realize real-world visibility and privacy constraints with smart contracts?




Investigative Questions:

Which constraints and real-world use cases are there?

Are Hyperledger Fabric, Corda or Quorum able to implement specific constraints?

Hyperledger fabric: 
permission based consensus blockchain
has chaincode
Fabric can run JS and Go on chain
Hyperledger seems to have fairly few nodes and is for industry
few and powerful nodes?	


Can we use Parity private contracts?

We do not quite understand how parity works
How does the contract know that the state-change was actually signed? 


What is the state-of-the-art regarding zkSNARKs, homomorphic encryption, for example on Ethereum?

Homomorphic encryption would use to much computational power
there is a client for zkSNARKS


How can we use voting mechanisms to propagate valid state changes without disclosing the state?

We might also use ring signatures for that voting process
