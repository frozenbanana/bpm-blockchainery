just read the first 3 pages!

nice quote in abstract/beginning: 
    blockchain/smart-contracts as app on decentralised, but singelton computer resource
        singelton machine with shared-state
    blockchain is incoruptable and transparent by definition

question: 
    how does GHOST protocol work?
