possible nice quotes: 
    Ethereum is major blockchain ecostystem [page 1]
    explanation why smart contracts run exactly as planned [page 1] (taken from Ethereum whitepaper)
    definition of mining/minors [page 2]
    reason why we need gas [page 2]
    why we can not execte computation heavy stuff on chain [page 3]

questions: 
    what is a stack-based language
    optcode?
    who can commnicate with a smart contract?

notes: 
    smart contract has contract balance
    when events are called, they are stored in logs
    they store only hash on-chain (like we might do)
    various patterns (also pattern that forces to wait and emergency stop)
