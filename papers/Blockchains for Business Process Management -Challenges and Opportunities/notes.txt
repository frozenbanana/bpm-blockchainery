Why is blockchain so great at managing inter-organization processes? 
Because blockchain is concerned with reaching a consent among the nodes 
this is what is needed to execute inter-company processes

Throughput: 
Very little throughput (7 transactions per second (tps) in Botcoin)
less relevant in private/consortium blockchains

latency
5 confirmation blocks, to ensure the block was included in the main chain
Bitcoin takes abt 65 min for a transaction
Etherium about 3 to 10 min
Improve latency by introducing Raiden and Lightning Network

Size: 
very many transactions mean that chain gets very large

Usability: 
hard to use/understand/develop

Security:
confidentiality low in distributed system
-> solution: Kosba et al. 2016 
integrity: good in blockchain
availability: Good, in terms of read performance

Wasted resources: 
proof-of-work :(
-> proof-of-stake Bethov et al.

Hard forks: 
can be issue in public blockchain

Blockchain for BPMN: 
pros:   
    immutable ledger
    independent process monitoring from global point of view
    encrypt data that should not be visible to public
