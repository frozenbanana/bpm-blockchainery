there are blockchain-as-a-service von MS Azure und IBM
escrow: 
	a smart contract
	holds funds, until obligation is reached

new transaction processing: 
	signed transaction send to node in blockchain network 
	if transaction is valid & unknown to node, then node will propagate it
	if the new tx reaches a miner, it might be append to the next block

categories of consensus protocol:
	proof-of-work
	proof-of-stake

decentralization: 
	fully centralized (e.g. banking system)
	fully decentralized/permission-less (e.g. Bitcoin)

permission (e.g. Ripple):
	chain with rbac

verification: 
	third party, that is trusted to provide info about 
	external world (e.g. oracle)
	centralized verifier may become single point of failure

validator:
	miner

data storage: 
	actual data often stored off-chain
	on-chain just the hash of the data

proof-of-stake
	alternative to proof-of-work
	decides on which block will be appended next 

What are sybil attacks? 
	generate pseudo identities 
	gain influence by having multiple identities (e.g. by changing
		voting outcomes)
	how vulnerable a system is to this attack depends on how 
		expensive it is to generate new identities
