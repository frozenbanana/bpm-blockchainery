# Introduction
This is a prototype were we experiment with privacy on the blockchain using a BPMN. The BPMN model an simple example using three clients and a backend on the blockchain (for now using a dummy server). The example BPMN we are using is of a Pizza place (P), delivery service (D) and Customer (C) [CHANGE]. Our mission with this peice of software is to show how they can reach consensus privately using the blockchain as backend. 

# Background
How can we ensure a Buinessess process model is private on a public ledger. A public ledger is per definition open for all participants to read the information written.

# Solution
Breaking the solution down into three different layers:
## Hide content
We don't want information to that is passing between participants to be public. Additionally we do not need messages to pass though the blockchain as long as consensus is ensured.

## Hide participants
The participants addresses should be kept secret.

## Hide logic
To ensure complete privacy we would be required to not show how the the model looks like. It should be resistant to process mining [INSERT LINK]
